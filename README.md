## MCB545 Course Overview

This course introduces experimental and analytical foundations of functional genomics, tailored to experimental biologists who are interested in using high-throughput sequencing technologies to analyze function in animal genomes. The overarching structure of this course tasks students with exploring the regulation and function of specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) through integrative analysis of multiple genomic assays with programming in R. This course combines lectures, which cover basic principles (e.g. genome assembly, annotation, functional genomic methods, statistics for genomic data), with in-class programming and assignments. Students submit a written synthesis of their findings and underlying code at the conclusion of the course.


## Learning Objectives

At the end of the course, through assignments, discussions, activities and assessments, students will be able to:
- Understand basic principles of modern functional genomics methods, including current sequencing, computational, and statistical approaches
- Interpret common data analysis and visualization techniques and apply these approaches using programming in R
- Integrate multi-omic data to generate quantitative analyses related to the regulation and function of a specific gene of interest.
