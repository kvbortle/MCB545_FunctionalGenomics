## MCB545 Course Overview

This course introduces both the experimental and analytical foundations of functional genomics tailored to students interested in understanding and leveraging modern genomic data to analyze gene regulation and function. Lectures cover basic principles (genome assembly, annotation, transcriptomics and epigenomics, functional perturbation methods, statistics and significance testing for genomic data, etc.) and are combined with hands-on programming and genomic data analysis. Students will apply concepts learned through lecture and discussion to the actual study of RNA-binding proteins, including gene regulatory mechanisms and downstream RBP function, by analyzing public, multi-omic data generated by recent genomic consortia, including ENCODE, The 4D Nucleome (4DN), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Students submit a final written synthesis of their findings and underlying code at the conclusion of the course.    


## Learning Objectives

At the end of the course, through assignments, discussions, activities and assessments, students will be able to:
- Understand basic principles of modern functional genomics methods, including current sequencing, computational, and statistical approaches
- Interpret common data analysis and visualization techniques and apply these approaches using programming in R
- Integrate multi-omic data to generate quantitative analyses related to the regulation and function of a specific gene of interest.
