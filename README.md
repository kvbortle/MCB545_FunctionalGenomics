## MCB545 Course Overview

This course introduces the experimental and analytical foundations of functional genomics, tailored to experimental biologists who are interested in using high-throughput sequencing technologies to analyze function in animal genomes. The overarching structure of this course tasks students with exploring the regulation and function of a specific RNA-binding protein (RBP) through analysis of multiple genomic assays. Students are tasked with retrieving publicly available sequencing data, applying standard quality control and processing pipelines in a high-performance computing environment, and executing differential and integrative data analyses through programming in R. This course combines lectures, which cover basic principles (e.g. genome assembly, gene/transcript annotation, functional genomic methods, statistics for genomic data), with in-class programming and assignments. Students present updates at specific intervals during the semester and submit a written synthesis of their findings at the conclusion of the course.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of the course, through assignments, discussions, activities and assessments, students will be able to:
- Understand basic principles of modern functional genomics methods and current sequencing approaches 
- Navigate and utilize a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster environment
- Apply data processing and quality control pipelines to evaluate high-throughput sequencing data 
- Perform computational analysis of sequencing-based genomic assays (RNA-seq, eCLIP-seq, and others). 
- Interpret common data visualization techniques and apply these approaches using R 
- Integrate multi-omic data to generate hypotheses related to the regulation and function of a specific gene of interest.
