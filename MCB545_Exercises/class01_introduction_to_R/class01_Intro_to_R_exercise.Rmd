## Section 1: Getting started

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Why R?

R is a programming language and software environment used for statistical analysis, graphical representation, and reporting. Originating in the statistics community, R has become a major tool in data science, bioinformatics, and many other fields.

-   **Statistical Analysis**: R is built for statistics, making it ideal for complex analyses.
-   **Open Source**: It's free to use and has a large community contributing to its development.
-   **Flexibility**: R can be integrated with other languages and can handle various data types and sources.
-   **R Packages**: A massive set of libraries for various purposes including graphical tools and statistical techniques.

### Installing R and RStudio

-   **R Installation**: Visit [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) and select the version for your operating system.
-   **RStudio Installation**: Download RStudio from [RStudio's website](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). RStudio is an IDE (integrated development environment) for R.

### Exploring the RStudio Interface

### R Markdown files

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. We will use R Markdown **.Rmd** files for MCB545 class exercises and assignments.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. Think of this document as a report for each of your assignments.

Code chunks are embedded in Markdown files, like this:

```{r intro to knitr}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Purpose of Triple Backticks: In Markdown and R Markdown, triple backticks are used to denote the start and end of a code block. Anything written between these backticks is treated as code and is formatted differently from the rest of the text. This is crucial for readability and clarity, especially when mixing narrative text with code snippets.

The triple backticks can be followed by a language identifier (like r for R, python for Python, etc.) to enable syntax highlighting specific to that language. For example, \`\`\`{r} for R code blocks in R Markdown.

The triple backticks in R Markdown are followed by curly braces {r} to indicate the beginning of an R code chunk. Inside these chunks, you can write R code that will be executed to produce output (like graphs or tables) in the final document.

While triple backticks are used for code blocks (larger sections of code), single backticks are used for inline code. Inline code is used when you want to refer to a piece of code within a line of text, like mentioning a variable `x` or a function `sum()`.

Above, we created a chunk of R code by specifying the programming language as R. We also added a title to the chunk ("Intro to Knitr"). *Note: Do not worry about understanding the code here yet, which is simply setting an option to include code chunks in the final output*

## Section 2: Basic Concepts in R

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Variables and Data Types

```{r}
# Creating variables
x <- 42
y <- "Genomics is fun!"
```

In R, a comment is created by putting a `#` symbol at the beginning of the line. Everything following the `#` on that line is treated as a comment.Comments are non-executable, which means the R interpreter ignores them when running the code. They are purely for human understanding.

In R, we use the `<-` symbol to assign values to variables. Think of it as an arrow pointing the value to the variable. This is how we store values in variables, allowing us to use and manipulate them later in our code. Although you might also see `=`, the `<-` is the traditional R way of assigning values. (Forgive me, you will see that I use `=`  )

A variable in R is created with a name (x, and y, above), which is a way to identify the stored data. The name can consist of letters, numbers, dots (.), and underscores (\_), but it must start with a letter or a dot not followed by a number. Case sensitivity is important in R, so Var, var, and VAR would be considered different variables.

```{r}
# Data types: Numeric, Character, Logical
is.numeric(x)
is.character(y)
```

The value assigned to a variable in R can be of various data types, including numeric, character, logical, etc., and can also be more complex data structures like vectors, matrices, data frames, or lists. Notice that variable x is numeric, and variable y is character. The value stored in a variable is not fixed and can be changed, meaning their values can be modified after they are created.

### Functions in R

Functions are one of the key building blocks of programming in R. They allow you to encapsulate a sequence of operations into a single, reusable unit. This can greatly enhance the readability and maintainability of your code. We use many base functions in R (i.e., see `is.numeric()` and `is.character()` above), but we can also create our own functions and acquire functions written by others by installing R packages. A function in R is a set of instructions that performs a specific task. It usually takes some input (known as arguments), processes them, and returns a result.

The basic structure of a function in R is as follows:

```{r}
my_function <- function(arg1, arg2) {
    # Function body
    result <- arg1 + arg2
    return(result)
}
```

To use a function, you call it by its name and pass the required arguments:

```{r}
my_function(10, 20)
```

Note that we just created a simple function that adds two arguments, there's a base function in R for that:

```{r}
sum(10,20)
```

But wait, I don't know what the function `sum()` does (ok, in this case it's self-explanatory but not always!) or what arguments this function expects. I need help!

### Finding Help in R

An essential step in programming is knowing how to find help and documentation. R has built-in help features that allow you to access documentation easily. One of the most straightforward ways to find help in R is using the help function, represented by the `?` symbol.

Whenever you need information about a specific function, dataset, or general topic in R, you can use the `?` followed by the topic's name. This command will open the relevant help page in R. To use the help function, simply type `?` followed by the name of the function or dataset you want information on. For example:

```{r}
# To get help on the sum function
?sum
# Or, you can use help()
help(sum)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Section 3: Importing data in R

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Often, the first step in data analysis is importing data from external sources. One common format for data is tab-delimited text files. R provides the `read.delim()` function to import these types of files easily. It assumes that your data is tab-separated and that the first row contains the column headers (or, you can set argument HEAD=FALSE if you do not have column headers, try using the help function referenced above to learn more about this function)

### read.delim() for importing tab-delimited files

The basic syntax of `read.delim()` is:

```{r}
# typically you will retrieve files on your local computer,
# however, for this course, we will often retrieve files from the course Github page:
# here we will explore a self-reported R proficiency poll by last year's MCB545 cohort:
R_poll = read.delim("https://github.com/kvbortle/MCB545_FunctionalGenomics/raw/refs/heads/main/MCB545_Exercises/class01_introduction_to_R/R_proficiency_poll_SP24.txt")
```

Ok, we just imported a tab-delimited file, how do we explore what's in the file?

```{r}
head(R_poll)
```

The R function head() displays the first 5 lines of the object R_poll, you can change it by modified the option n, for example:

```{r}
head(R_poll, n = 10)
```

The R function str() displays the structure of our R object:

```{r}
str(R_poll)
```

Notice that the data structure of R_poll is `data.frame`, we have 8 variables of data type `int` (Integer) with 26 observations for each. *Note, here every observation represents a student, 1 represents the self-reported proficiency, 0 represents a selection that was note chosen*

Another useful function is `summary()`, which provides some basic statistics for each variable:

```{r}
summary(R_poll)
```

### Other functions for reading in files:

Keep in mind that we may not always be working with tab-delimited files, and that using other functions may be more useful, such as `read.csv()` for comma separated values (.CSV). There are also methods that speed up reading in extraordinarily large files, such as the `fread()` function from the R package, [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Section 4: Plotting in R

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several functions in base R for data visualization. Let's use the function `barplot()` to visualize the distribution of self-reported proficiencies in R programming at the start of this course. First let's make a vector of the total number of self-reported programmers at each belt level, using the `colSums` function:

```{r}
tally = colSums(R_poll)
print(tally)
```

Now, we can plot these entries with the `barplot()` function. The column names are conveniently the color we wanted for each barplot, so we can supply them to the `col` option in barplot (below)

```{r}
barplot(tally, col=colnames(R_poll), ylab="# of MCB545 Students", main="Self-reported proficiency in R (MCB545, Spring 2024)")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Section 5: Subsetting in R

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will often want to subset on a specific variable or condition, as a simple example, how can we retrieve only the information from `R_poll` in which the student self-reported a proficiency of "Purple Belt in R programming".

### subset() function in R

One method involves using the `subset()` function in R

```{r}
purp = subset(R_poll, purple == 1)
print(purp)
```

Note here that `subset()` expects a logical expression indicating elements or rows to keep, missing values are taken as false. Here, my condition is that the variable purple is 1. The `==` operator is used to test if two values are equal. It compares the value on its left with the value on its right and returns TRUE if they are equal and FALSE otherwise.The `!=` operator is used to test if two values are not equal. It compares the value on its left with the value on its right and returns TRUE if they are not equal and FALSE if they are equal.

### Brackets for subsetting

Brackets `[]` are used to subset objects like vectors, matrices, and data frames by specifying indices or conditions directly. For example, knowing that the student self-reported as a Purple Belt in R is the 20th row, we can easily subset for row 20 using brackets:

```{r}
purp = R_poll[20,]
print(purp)
```

Here, rows and columns are separated by a comma. We have selected the 20th row by placing 20 before the comma. By not including a value after the comma, we are not subsetting for any column (so, all columns are included). What if we only wanted the value in the 20th row AND the 6th column?

```{r}
purp = R_poll[20,6]
print(purp)
```

*Note that we can also use brackets for one-dimensional structures, in which you can select specific entries:*

```{r}
tmp = R_poll[,6]
# What did we do here? we've selected column 6, now tmp is a 1-dimensional vector
print(tmp)
tmp = tmp[20]
# What did we do here? We've selected the 7th entry in a 1-dimensional vector. A comma will not work
print(tmp)
```

We can also combine brackets with conditions:

```{r}
tmp = row.names(R_poll)[R_poll$white == 1]
print(tmp)
```

This process may not be immediately straightforward, but once you become comfortable with it, it offers a very quick & easy approach for subsetting

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Section 6: Installing packages in R

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CRAN (install.packages)

The most commonly used R packages are available through the CRAN repository (Comprehensive R Archive Network). Let's revisit our plot above, but use a function from the [scales](https://scales.r-lib.org/) R package to introduce transparency to our plot

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("scales")
```

Once installed, we need to use the `library()` function to make the "scales" package functions become available to us, we specifically want to make use of the `alpha()` function to add transparency to our colors:

```{r}
library("scales")

barplot(colSums(R_poll), col=alpha(colnames(R_poll), 0.1), ylab="# of MCB545 Students", main="Self-reported proficiency in R (MCB545, Spring 2024)")

```

### Bioconductor (BiocManager)

Bioconductor is an open-source project that provides tools for the analysis of high-throughput genomic data. It's widely used in the field of computational biology and integrates with the R programming environment, offering a wide range of specialized packages for genomic data analysis.

Bioconductor packages are not part of the standard R package repository (CRAN), so they are installed using a specific Bioconductor installation function.

```{r install-bioconductor, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install()
```

This code checks if BiocManager is installed (the package used to install Bioconductor packages) and installs it if it's not already present. Then, it uses BiocManager::install() to set up Bioconductor.Once Bioconductor is set up, you can install individual packages using BiocManager::install().
